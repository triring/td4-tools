# td4-tools
This project is a toolset created to support learning and development of the TD4, a 4-bit CPU made famous by Iku Watanami in his book [How to Create a CPU](https://book.mynavi.jp/ec/products/detail/id=22065).   By using an assembler and emulator implemented in Go, you can develop for the TD4 even if you don't have the actual device on hand.
